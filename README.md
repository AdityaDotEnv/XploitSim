# 🧠 XploitSim – Interactive OWASP Vulnerability Sandbox

🚀 **Live Demo:** [https://xploitsim.netlify.app](https://xploitsim.netlify.app)
💻 **Built With:** React, Node.js, and a dash of curiosity

---

## ⚡ Overview

**XploitSim** is an interactive sandbox designed to **demonstrate OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities** — safely, visually, and in a hands-on environment.
It provides a **controlled simulation of web exploits** such as **Authentication Failures**, allowing students, developers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts to explore the “how” and “why” of security misconfigurations without any real-world risk.

Each module comes with:

* 📘 A clear explanation of the vulnerability
* 💣 A live “Try it Yourself” simulation
* 🧩 Insights on prevention and secure coding

---

## 🧩 Current Focus: Authentication Failures

Our first live module focuses on **Authentication Failures (OWASP A02:2021)**.
This includes:

* Manual login & registration flow with password validation
* Credential stuffing simulation
* Account lockout demonstration after repeated failed attempts
* Live console logs to show attack progression

This sandbox serves as both a **teaching tool** and a **developer awareness platform** — helping you visualize what happens under the hood during an authentication breach attempt.

## 🛠️ Setup & Configuration

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xplotisim.git
cd xplotisim
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
Hot reload is enabled — any change you make is instantly reflected.

### 4️⃣ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build inside the `/build` folder — ready for deployment.

## 🧠 Vision

XploitSim aims to bridge the gap between **cybersecurity theory and practice**.
Instead of reading static definitions, users can **see attacks happen**, **interact** with mitigation measures, and **understand** the flow of exploitation.

Our long-term goal:

> To make every OWASP Top 10 vulnerability accessible, interactive, and safe for learners worldwide.
